: Build a model using publicly available data for key *national* demand & supply factors that could influence US home prices. Use that to explain how these factors impacted home prices over the last ~20 years. You can use the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA.

Definitions
- A national factor is one that impacts home prices nationally. For example:
•	The US unemployment rate is a national factor
•	Boston’s unemployment rate is NOT a national factor
•	Avg. no of bedrooms in California is not a national factor
- A demand factor is one that primarily impacts demand for homes from consumers. (Ex. Unemployment rate)

- A supply factor is one that primarily impacts the supply of homes (i.e. total homes available for sale). (Ex. Availability of land)
